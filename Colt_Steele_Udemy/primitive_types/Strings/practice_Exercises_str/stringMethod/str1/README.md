### Stirng Methods Practice
<p>Let's ge some practice working with string methods. I've provided you with a variable in index.js call <span style= "color: orange; border: 1px solid white; padding: 0 5px">message</span>. Without altering the original value stored in <span>message</span>, please define a variable called <span style= "color: orange; border: 1px solid white; padding: 0 5px">whisper</span> that is a <b>lowercased</b> version of <span style= "color: orange; border: 1px solid white; padding: 0 5px">message</span>, with all the extra space at the begining and end removed. You will need to use <b>two string methods that we just covered</b>. Dont't forget you can chain them together on a single line
