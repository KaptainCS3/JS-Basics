### String Template Literal Exercise
<p> I've provided you with two variable, <span style= "color: orange; border: 1px solid white; padding: 0 5px">die1</span>
and <span style= "color: orange; border: 1px solid white; padding: 0 5px">die2</span> which represent six-sided dice. Each variable holds a randomly generated integer from 1 to 6. Please create a new variable called <span style= "color: orange; border: 1px solid white; padding: 0 5px">roll</span>, which will be a string that display each die as well as their sum.<p><br> 
<ul>
<p>Follow this pattern:</p>
<br>
 <li>die1: 3</li><br>
 <li>die2: 5</li><br>
 <li>roll: "You rolled a 3 and a 5. They sum to 8"</li>
</ul>
<br>
  <ul>
  <p>Here is another example with different numbers:</p>
  <br>
 <li>die1: 6</li><br>
 <li>die2: 4</li><br>
 <li>roll: "You rolled a 6 and a 5. They sum to 10"</li>
</ul>
